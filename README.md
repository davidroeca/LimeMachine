## LimeMachine

A simple file-based music app, with the initial goal of simplicity in
integration with simple music playlists generated by apps like clementine.

## Goals
The hope will be that integration with this player will be compatible and
simple on all operating systems, since all user interactions will be
file-based.

This is currently a work in progress. Compile at your own risk.

## License

Mozilla Public License 2.0

Reasoning: I'd rather GPL, but that leads to strange incompatibilities with
the Apple app store if I so choose to release it.
