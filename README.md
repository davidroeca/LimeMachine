## LimeMachine

An app that *takes you back* to the days when music apps were simple. I plan
to integrate it with Clementine (see the citrus theme?) as my desktop music
player.

## Goals

* Playlists can be imported and exported as *files*
* Songs can be imported as *files*
* Any operating system that sanely manages/tracks *files* should be supported
* Future Goal: FLAC support on all systems (looking at you, iOS)

## Nice to have

* Cloud music service integration (e.g. soundcloud, spotify, etc.)
* Cloud file service integration (e.g. Dropbox, Box, Google Drive)

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work in progress. Compile at your own risk.

## License

Mozilla Public License 2.0

Reasoning: I'd rather GPL, but that leads to strange incompatibilities with
the Apple app store if I so choose to release it.
